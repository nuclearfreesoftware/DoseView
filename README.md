DoseView
========

Google Glass viewer for radiation dose data collected as part of the Safecast project


THIS SOFTWARE IS AT AN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE - USE WITH CAUTION!


It should be possible to install the included apk file using the Android Debug Bridge (adb). Afterwards, it can be started via voice command ("show radiation levels"), or via the menu. If the glass has internet connection and access to location services, it will display data from the safecast project (www.safecast.org). The project is a crowd-sourcing project to collect radiation levels for different locations.
